\033[1m What is a System? \033[0m
A system is not just hardware + sofeware, it also includes people and immediate environment. A system may include: training employees and/or users, as well as maintaining and protecting data or hardware.

A new system should improve the cost-to-benefit ratio in contrast to not implementing the system.

There are a bunch of reason to implement a new system: replace a current system because it's inefficient, no longer suitable for desired tasks, or redunant or out-dated.
The system may be added for a purpose that is new for an organization.

\033[1m Legacy Systems \033[0m

An Example would be a hospital and the systems it uses: Clinical, Accounting, Pharmacy, and Purchasing. These systems sometimes need to communicate with each other but are also sometimes stored in indivisual silos and silos do not communcate with each other. 
\033[1m Multiple systems that do not communicate with each other are called Legacy Systems \033[0m

There are some situtations where moderns systems have to work together with legacy systems.
An example would be, if the legacy system contains a lot of data it is not realistic to transfer all the data unless there is an automated way to.

\033[1m Planning \033[0m
When planning on implementing a new system, including discussing new hardware, changing potential locations of technology, new policiess, new training and upskilling, and potentially hiring and firing employees as well.

There is also a varity of issues that should be taken into consideration during the planning process:
A lack of ...
  - Organizational & Bussiness strategy
  - Stakeholder & end-user participation
  -End-user 'ownership'

Attention to ...
  -Required training
  -Organizational issues, inclding group culture
  -Design of tasks & job roles
  -Overall usability of the system

After considering the issues mentioned above a feasibility study should be conducted, the study should cover different areas. A common acronym is TELOS.

T: Technical (Here all hardware and software would be justified in whether it is necessary for the new system)
E: Economic (Relates to the budget for a project and how money will be spent, financial costs for purchasing new hardware or software, cost on training staff or timelines running past deadlines)
L: Legal (are there any conflicts between the proposed system and any local laws, regulation, etc.)
O: Operational (Realtes to whether the participants will be able to handle the new system. Factors that need to be considered include the technical skills of employees, as well whether or not raining will be nescessary for sstaff and what materials would need ro be avaliable for training.)
S: Schedule (Relates to the amount of time allocated to the development of the new system. The time frame would be assessed, as projects that run overtime can have both a financial and organizational impact on business.)

\033[1m Changing Management \033[0m
Changing systems almsot always includes some form of change management. This may ne shifting, hiring, or letting go employees or whole deparments, it may be just changing the process or work they do.

Organizantial Change
  -Refers to the actions in which a company or business alters a major componet of its organization such as: its culture, underlying technologies or infrastructure it uses to operate, or its internal processes.

Change is often approached with concern, and sometimes fear; especially if it includes new tech or somputerized/automated systems. Change management should maximize benefits and mimimize negatives, for all stakeholders, including the employees.

Successful change management should result in buy-in from all stakeholders. Resistance or conflict related to new processes or work stations suggests change mangagement was not entirely successful. Some famay fear that they may lose their job with increased automation, and unfortuanately this sometimes comes true.

\033[1m Business Mergers \033[0m
  - Mergers combine two seperate businesses into a single new legal entity. True megers are uncommmon because it's rare for two equal companies to mutaully benefit from combing resources and staff, including their CEOs. 

\033[1m Modern Example from the US Post Office \033[0m
Almost all letters in the US are taken to the closest processing center, where cameras and computer take a picture of the front of the envelope and read the address with optical characyer regonition, OCR.
What if the handwriting on the letter is bad?
The post office have a system in place where letters are sent to a facility to verify what the handwriting is saying.
The system they have in place is solefy for the purpose of reading bad writing and to make it more efficent for the person who is reading the hand writing. From the software that is used to the custom key board that are used for their work.
On the software being used, it tracks that amount the work and progress that been made for the day.
There are rules that the person who is reading that have to follow such as the 3+1 rule and writing exactly what the sender wrote.

\033[1m Hypothetical Example \033[0m
If this new system was implemented some affects that might happen is that if there was multiple secretaries to help put in the order than some would be let go since the salesperson is now handling the orders and not the secretaries.
